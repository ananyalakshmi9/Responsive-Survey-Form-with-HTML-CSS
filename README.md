# Indian Budget 2024 Survey Form

A static, single-page web application built with HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript to display information about the Indian Budget 2024 and collect user feedback.

## 🎯 Key Features

* **Informational Layout:** Clearly presents budget highlights and government schemes in a structured layout using `div` containers and a `table`.
* **Custom Styling:** A dedicated CSS file (`budget_css.css`) provides styling for layout, colors, borders, element positioning, and hover effects.
* **Interactive Form:** Includes a comprehensive HTML form with various input types like text fields, radio buttons, email, telephone number, a dropdown select menu, and a textarea.
* **Client-Side Validation:** Uses HTML5 attributes like `required` and `pattern` for basic browser-side form validation.
* **JavaScript Feedback:** A simple JavaScript function provides an immediate confirmation `alert` to the user upon form submission without reloading the page.
* **Static & Self-Contained:** Runs entirely in the browser without needing a backend server, making it easy to deploy and test.
